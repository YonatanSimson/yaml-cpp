== A YAML parser and emitter for C++

This is just a mirror of the project on
GoogleCode[http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/].

Branch _trunk_ reflects the original svn trunk, branch _master_
contains a simplified makefile for building a static library.

Svn tagged branches are available as git tags, too!

=== Changelog

* 2011-04-08: fixed a nasty bug on binary data emitter
* 2011-03-07: added Makefile
